## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page  
- View the card layout adapt across different screen sizes (mobile to desktop)

## My process  

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS custom properties**  
- **Flexbox**  
- **Clamp()** for responsive typography  
- **Mobile-first workflow**  

---

### What I learned  

One of the biggest learnings was how to use the **`clamp()`** CSS function to make typography and layout elements responsive without relying heavily on media queries.  

Example from my project:  

```css
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.1rem, 3vw, 1.6rem);
}

This allows the font size to scale smoothly between mobile and desktop screen sizes, while ensuring it never gets too small or too large.

---

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Explore more **fluid responsive design** techniques without media queries.  
- Use **CSS Grid** in combination with clamp for even more scalable layouts.  
- Experiment with **modern CSS functions** like `min()`, `max()`, and `aspect-ratio`.
